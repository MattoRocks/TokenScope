# TokenScope
TokenScope is a tool to investigate the metadata and history of non-fungible Ethereum tokens. Currently, it exists as an HTML site.

In addition to the custom javascript I coded, production environments would require:

Javascript packages: JQuery, zero-md, DOMPurify; and an Opensea.io API (they're free, you just have to ask through their API documentation page.).



## Future plans include using web3 to allow a user to investigate tokens they own.
